# SurvivalAnalysis 
In this project, we aim at analyzing time to event in parkinson disease patients. The event of interest here is freezig of gait (FOG). This motion impairement event is most of the time experienced by people in this population. Here the status is any kinetic event indicating FOG, experienced or not by these patients. We will also investigate group difference reharding time to FOG.

Data has been gather from competition data on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tlvmc-parkinsons-freezing-gait-prediction#:~:text=Research%20Code%20Competition-,Parkinson%27s,-Freezing%20of%20Gait).
