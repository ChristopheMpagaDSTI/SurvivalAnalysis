# SurvivalAnalysis 
In this project, we aim to analyse time to event in parkinsonian patients. The event of interest here is freezig of gait (FOG). This motion impairement event is most of the time experienced by people in this population. Here the status is any kinetic event indicating FOG, experienced or not by these patients. Our analysis will focuse on features that characterize or that help to understand the occurence of FOG.

Data has been gather from competition data on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tlvmc-parkinsons-freezing-gait-prediction#:~:text=Research%20Code%20Competition-,Parkinson%27s,-Freezing%20of%20Gait). 
Our analysis is still ongoing and we are for the moment performing 1D EDA.
